# dynamic-spin-hall-mag
Python code developed during my dissertation to model dynamic spin-Hall magnetoresistance in ferromagnetic (FM) / paramagnetic (NM)  bilayer systems. This incorporates static spin-Hall magnetoresistance theory, magnetisation dynamics described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, and spin pumping theory. The program simulates the monodomain magnetisation dynamics in the FM under an effective field, in the presence of a possible spin-orbit torque induced by the spin-Hall effect in the paramagnetic layer. Outputs the magnetisation direction in the FM layer as well as the voltage in the longitudinal (x) and transverse (y) direcions (see the figure below).
